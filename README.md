# Crimson-Coals
My First Actual Public Mod

Built with Minecraft 1.16.4, Forge 35.0.15, IntelliJ

So this is my first delve into Modding and Java.  My projects will be simple, and most likely wrong

Im watching many tutorials and am super hyped

Questions, Comments and advice is greatly welcome, but speak slow, I am a new

I best learn by example, so any simple code snippets are greatly welcome
